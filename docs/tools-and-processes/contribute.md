## Contribute to Docs

These are some ways to get your first task:

1. <b>Work on existing docs issues</b>: Look for issues with the `docs`, `documentation`, `area/docs`, and `good-first-issue` tags on the [Docs Project board](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/projects/12).

2. <b>Update current docs</b>: Surf the existing documentation, look for typos, grammar, and errors, create an issue, and send a Pull Request. 

3. <b>Propose new docs</b>: If you have any ideas or suggestions for necessary documentation, create an issue and ask for help to work on the task.

4. <b>Connect with a docs mentor</b>: Send a DM via [Slack](https://www.asyncapi.com/slack-invite) to Alejandra Quetzalli to get assigned to a task.

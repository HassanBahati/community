## Contribute to docs

These are several ways to get your first docs task:

1. <b>Work on existing docs issues</b>: Look for issues with the `docs` or `docs bug` and `good-first-issue` labels on the [Docs Project board](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/projects/12).

2. <b>Update current docs</b>: Surf the existing documentation, look for `typos`, `grammar`, `errors`, create an issue, and submit a Pull Request. 

3. <b>Propose new docs</b>: If you have any ideas or suggestions for necessary documentation, [create a new docs issue](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/issues/new?labels=%F0%9F%93%91+docs&projects=&template=docs.yml&title=%5B%F0%9F%93%91+Docs%5D%3A+) and propose yourself as the assignee. 

4. <b>Connect with a docs maintainer</b>: Ask for a `good-first-issue` in the `#13_docs` channel of the [AsyncAPI Slack](https://www.asyncapi.com/slack-invite) workspace.

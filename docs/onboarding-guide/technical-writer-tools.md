## Tools for Technical Writers

To effectively contribute to the AsyncAPI project documentation, you will need the following
range of tools to author technical documentation;

#### 1. Hardware and Internet
- A laptop or desktop computer capable of running the tools necessary for contributing to the project.
- Stable internet access to clone the project repository, submit contributions and stay updated on project changes.

#### 2. Software and Platforms
- [GitHub](https://github.com) account: All our project's source code and documentation are hosted on GitHub. You'll need an account to create issues, fork the repository, submit pull requests, etc. If you're new to GitHub, familiarize yourself with its [basic functionalities](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started) and workflows.

#### 3. Authoring and publishing tools
- Code editor:  Any text editor or IDE capable of handling Markdown files should suffice  (we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), but you can choose).
- Managing docs (wiki, source control, content management system)
    - [Git](https://git-scm.com), [GitHub](https://github.com)

Remember, these are just the basic requirements. Additional tools or software may be required depending on the complexity and specific tasks. Always refer to the specific documentation guidelines or ask project maintainers for clarification.
